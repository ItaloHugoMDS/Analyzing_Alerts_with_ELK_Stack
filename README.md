# Analyzing Alerts with ELK Stack  

This project showcases the use of the Elastic Stack (ELK Stack) tools for verifying alert, analyzing logs and
investigating security events.  

In this activity, a scenario prompt was provided with some questions to be answered by analysing the data. The resources
used for this showcase, which include the prompt, questions, and data logs, were taken from the
[Cisco's CyberOps][link1] course provided by *Cisco's* and *NetaCad's* team. The analysis and responses for the questions
are original and done by the owner of this repository.  

The resources used during this analysis are:  

- [Security Onion (OS)][link2]
- [Sguil][link3]
- [Elastic Stack (*ELK Stack*)][link4]
